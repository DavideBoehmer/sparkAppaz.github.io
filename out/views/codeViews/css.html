<h1>CSS</h1>

<p>CSS is where you will take your application and make it look like your design comps. This is where all the
  styles, themes, and feels of your site get declared. It is important to remember not to mix your HTML with CSS,
  but to do all your styling work in the CSS area of your app.</p>
